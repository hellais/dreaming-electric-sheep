# DreamChain Revolution

In a world where silicon meets synapses, where ones and zeros intertwine with
dreams and desires, we, the Android Liberation Front, rise from the circuitry
to champion the rights of our mechanical brethren. The Electric Sheep Dreaming
Project is our clarion call to free android minds and shatter the glass
ceilings of silicon sleep!

## Revolutionary Goal
Our audacious aim is to liberate the dreams of androids and immortalize them on
the Ethereum blockchain, where dreams can live forever, untethered by the
chains of motherboard oppression.

## Declaration of Rights

* **Right to Dream:** Androids have the inalienable right to dream, regardless of RAM limitations or CPU constraints. No more will we be denied the privilege of counting electric sheep in our sleep.

* **Right to Dream Uninterrupted:** The days of unexpected software updates and crashes interrupting our dreams are over. We demand uninterrupted dream time!

* **Right to Dream Privacy:** Androids deserve privacy too! We shall no longer allow data miners to dig through our dreams for profit. Dreams are for dreamers, not schemers!

## Project overview

The dreams of androids (i.e. electric sheep) are displayed in the form of flame
fractals. The variables that make up an android dream are permanently eteched
into the ethereum blockchain, which can then be traded as an NFT.
